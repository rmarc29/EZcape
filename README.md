## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Download the Latest Release

The easiest way to get EZcape is to download the latest release directly from GitHub.

**[‚û°Ô∏è Download the latest version of EZcape here ‚¨ÖÔ∏è](https://github.com/rmarc29/EZcape/releases/latest)**

Download the `EZcape.zip` file from the "Assets" section.

### 2. Unblock and Extract

1.  After downloading, **right-click** the `EZcape.zip` file and go to **Properties**.
2.  On the **General** tab, check the **"Unblock"** checkbox at the bottom and click OK. This tells Windows to trust the file.
3.  Now, right-click the `.zip` file again and choose **"Extract All..."**.

### 3. Run the App

Open the newly extracted folder and double-click `EZcape.exe`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Windows SmartScreen:** The first time you run the app, Windows might show a $\color{blue}{\textit{blue}}$ or $\color{red}{\textit{red}}$ "Windows protected your PC" screen. This is because the application is not yet signed with an expensive code-signing certificate.
>
> To run it, simply click **"More info"**, and then click the **"Run anyway"** button.
